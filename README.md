# About
### Description and motivation
A Spotify web player client clone that is supported and powered by the Spotify Ltd. public API.
By honing my skills in a more complex project, I had to replicate the main functionalities, interactions, and/or user interfaces of the original application, with support for the browsers Mozilla, Safari, and Google Chrome, as well as their mobile versions.
As a result of this, I had to reconsider some long-held beliefs about the management of asynchronicity, navigation, and responsiveness.

# Special Thanks
Thanks to [@bchiang7](https://github.com/bchiang7)'s [Spotify-profile](https://spotify-profile.herokuapp.com) repository, I was inspired to make this version of Spotify.
I was able to include some unique concepts into my repo, and I'd want to recognize [@gilbarbara](https://github.com/gilbarbara)'s work with his [react-spotify-web -playback](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-spotify-web-playback) repo. That makes add several features quite easier, such as the Spotify web player, which saved me a lot of time in the development process. God's blessings to you.
